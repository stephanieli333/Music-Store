The goal of the assignment was to read and store a list of songs (see songSubset.txt for an example) with year, title, and artist info in a "Music Store". They were stored using a self-implemented hashtable, which takes generic types <Key> and <Value>. The generic type allows simultaneous construction and updating (by adding new songs) of three different hashtables, which allows the user to search songs by artist, title, or year.
